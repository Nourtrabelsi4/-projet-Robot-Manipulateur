# -projet-Robot-Manipulateur
A robotic manipulator consisting of a mobile cart and a 3D-printed robotic arm. The manipulator can be controlled using a custom Android application. Additionally, the application features buttons to independently control the speed of the cart and arm.

However, the standout feature of this robot is its ability to store and automatically repeat movements. Using the Record button, we can simply store motor positions for each step. Then, by clicking the Execute button, the robot will automatically repeat the stored movements over and over again.
